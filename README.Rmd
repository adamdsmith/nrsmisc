# Installing `nrsmisc`

The `nrsmisc` package requires you to have [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (>= 3.3) installed on your computer as well as [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).  Both will require administrative priveleges but the installation of packages after this initial install will not.

With R and Rtools installed, it's simple to install and load the `nrsmisc` package to access its functionality. 

**NOTE**: If you receive a SSL or CA Certificate error, you may need to take the extra step documented below.  

```
# If devtools package is not installed
install.packages("devtools", dependencies = TRUE)

# Now install and load nrsmisc
devtools::install_github("adamdsmith/nrsmisc")
library("nrsmisc")

# If you receive a SSL or CA Certificate error
install.packages("httr")
library("httr")
set_config(config(ssl_verifypeer = 0L))
devtools::install_github("adamdsmith/nrsmisc")
library("nrsmisc")
```

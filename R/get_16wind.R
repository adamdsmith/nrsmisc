#' Retrieve the point of a 16-wind compass rose for 0-360 degree bearings
#'
#' This function converts compass bearings into one of 16 22.5 degree wide
#'  abbreviated text directions - specifically the eight principal winds
#'  (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) and eight half-winds that bisect the angles
#'  between the principal winds (NNE, ENE, ESE, SSE, SSW, WSW, WNW, NNW). The
#'  eight principal winds and the eight half-winds together form the 16-wind
#'  compass rose, with each compass point at a 22 1‚ÅÑ2' angle from its neighbors
#'
#' @param degrees numeric or integer vector of compass bearings, in degrees and
#'   constrained between 0 and 360 degrees
